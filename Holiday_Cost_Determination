This program logic helps customers calculate the total cost of a holiday trip based on their choice travel destination between three prescribed options, hotel stay based on length of stay, and car rental needs.

How it works:
The program prompts the user to select a destination from a predefined list.
The user enters the number of hotel nights and the number of days for car rental.

The program calculates:
Flight cost – Based on destination (three destinations)
Accommodation cost – Per-night rate depending on destination.
Car rental cost – Fixed daily rate.
It then returns a full cost breakdown along with the total holiday cost.
